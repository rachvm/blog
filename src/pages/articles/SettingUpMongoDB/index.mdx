## Setting The Scene

Now that I have an understanding of MongoDB queries, the next step is to create a backend which eventually could be sent to a frontend
using cors. I have decided to work this out by myself from my understanding from using PostgreSQL because I learn better from 
working it out rather than following tutorials.

## Getting Coding...

During the last post, the Cluster was created, so to continue with the free account I created a new database within the cluster. 

Next was to design the setup and inserted a documment. This can either be done with empty data, or in this case I 
decided to start inserting information for the first post for my chat app. 

<Image src={document} alt="Document Inserted with value types"/> 

This was a straightforward process as it requires the user to click on where to add text, and a drop down box appears when you hover 
over the field type. Then I added three more documents, which was a simple process of cloning the document and changing the input. 
MongoDB supports the user when adding information on their website, and as soon as data is inputted in correctly it appears red.

Next the backend was set up with express and relevant folders, and as mentioned in the previous post I undertook a database check to
ensure I was correctly linked to MongoDB. This meant I was now able to set up my models and routes folder, and to begin with I was 
going to fetch all the data I had added in MongoDB.

Using the query information from this tutorial https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/node-crud-tutorial/ and my understanding
of connecting databases with SQL I was able to fetch all the data from my collection using Postman. Below is the code from my models file:

```c

import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config()

const uri = process.env.ATLAS;
const client = new MongoClient(uri);
const database = client.db('gettogether');
const collection = database.collection('chat');

export async function getAllPosts() {
    const message = collection.find()
    const results = await message.toArray();
    return results
}

```

## Next Steps

Now that I have my backend interacting with MongoDB, I will need to set up the front end using ReactJS, so that 
this can be displayed in the app.
