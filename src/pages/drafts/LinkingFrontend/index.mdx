## Setting The Scene

CORS Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a useful npm package that allows the frontend such as ReactJS to link with the backend ExpressJS, in the post I am going to look into how this works
and how data is passed from one to the other. I will also link the backend I created during the last blog to the frontend so that I can display the 
data from MongoDB

## Research on CORS

CORS works by using HTTP-headers to allow the backend to access information sent by the front end. For information to be successfully pass the frontend must send headers to indicates the
HTTP method and Headers required for the actual request. In the case of linking to a database thes are known as CRUD operations create, read, update and delete, but in terms of the HTTP 
request POST is the create header, GET is the read header, PATCH is the update header, and DELETE remains the same as the delete header. Information can be passed though a response such 
as the code below for a POST request to add information

```c
const addNote = async (text) => {
		const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api', {
			method: 'POST',
			headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
			body: JSON.stringify({ content: text }),
		})
```

or in can be added to the HTTP such as the code below for a delete request.

```c
const deleteNote = async (id) => {
		await fetch(`http://localhost:5000/api/${id}`, {
			method: 'DELETE',
		})
```


## Getting Coding...

In my previous blog Initialising Collection in MongoDB I was able to get the posts from Mongo Db using ExpressJS and NodeJS, and used Postman to show this.
Today I'm going to make get requests in a front end using ReactJS, and using CORS to link this to the backend NodeJS to be able to display the posts held in MongoDB.
After setting up a create-react-app, the first step is to set up a useEffect hook to send the HTTP request, as below

```c
  useEffect(() => {
    async function getPost () {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3008/api/chat')
      const data = await response.json()
      const allposts = data.payload
      setLike(allposts)
    } getPost()
  }, []);

```

I haven't used the headers as talked about in the above section because I am only requesting data rather than sending, but as the project moves onto areas such as create operations using post, 
these will be needed. From this I was able to map through the data requested, and show the posts and replies as held on MongoDB.
